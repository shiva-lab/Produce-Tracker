Produce Tracker
# Approved

Abstract:


Produce goods distribution has been something that always has some flaws, as the way manufacturers and distrubters vary from one place to another. The tracking of these produce goods from one place to another are managed by many different databases. Our approach would be to instead of storing it in a database is to use a ledger (Blockchain) to track all produce goods. The time and place where it comes from can be secured on a secured platform to ensure the ability to track any good produce purchased by customers.


The project first step would be to try and find as much data possible from all manufacturers and distributors. This step would be the most challenging one as it will be difficult to find data regarding purchase of produce goods.


This application would be targeted to customers (distributors, retailers, people).


The application MVP would be a simple UI that you are able to login. After logging in using OAuth you would be asked between two options, to look up a sale or to register a sale. The UI which is developed using React would show what information is needed to to fill and then a blockchain would be created registering the sale. Other features that could be implemented in the future includes predicting what distributers might hand out damaged goods along with recommendation for specific produce.


One use case would be the problem California is facing with E Coli Roman Lettuce. The valley has been producing a lot of Roman Lettuce affected by this bacteria and has been a concern. Our application would enable all the customers to be able to register all purchases made of Roman Lettuce. After inputting this data the website would run the updated data through different algorithms and help give feedback on area with most likely infected products along with recommended places to go to purchase these types of products.






The web application will be using a frontend and backend framework to display the home page then be able to route through the application. For the frontend part the technology that would be used mostly ReactJS along with minor tools such as less and other npm libraries that can help development such as React Boostrap. Redux is a potential tool that could be use to ease up the data flow between the REST API NodeJS calls. On the side we will have our dataset training by using Pytorch, Sci Kit Learn, Tensorflow to run the data on algorithms to provide the application with the percentages and the coloring of the hot areas.
